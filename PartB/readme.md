# PartB Web Application

## Project Overview

The **PartB Web Application** is a basic web-based project that focuses on creating an interactive and responsive user experience using standard web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project demonstrates a modular design approach by separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

### Purpose

This project aims to serve as:

1. A learning tool for beginners in web development.
2. A starting template for small-scale web applications or personal projects.

## Project Structure

```
PartB/

├── styles.css        # Styling for a cohesive and responsive design
└── script.js         # JavaScript functionality for dynamic interactions
```

### File Descriptions

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that forms the structure of the application. It links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
